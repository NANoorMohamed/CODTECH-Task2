### Project: Vulnerability Scanner

### Objective
Build a tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities.

### Key Activities
Vulnerability scanning involves checking systems, networks, or web applications for security weaknesses. The goal is to identify open ports, outdated software, misconfigurations, and other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

# Focus on common vulnerabilities:
**Open Ports:** Scan for services that may expose sensitive information or access points.

**Outdated Software:** Identify outdated software versions with known vulnerabilities.

**Misconfigurations:** Check for incorrect settings such as improper file permissions or default credentials.

### Technologies Used
You can use Python, Go, or other scripting languages to build the vulnerability scanner. Python is popular due to libraries like scapy, socket, nmap, and others that can help with network scanning.

    Python with nmap (Network Mapper) is a good option, 
    because nmap is a widely used tool for discovering hosts and services on a network. 
    You can interact with nmap in Python using the python-nmap library.
